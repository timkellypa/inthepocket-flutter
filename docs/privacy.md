# Privacy Policy for In the Pocket

**Last Updated:** 07 Oct 2023

I respect your privacy and am committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure. This Privacy Policy explains that In the Pocket does not collect, use, or share any personal or non-personal information from its users.

## Information Collection

In the Pocket does not collect any personal or non-personal information from users. I do not track your activities, request access to device features, or store any data on my servers.  In fact the application has no server-side component.  All data is stored locally in sqlite on the device, and there are no features to store remotely or share setlists.  Everything is done locally on the device.

Spotify integration uses OAuth to read your personal playlists, so the app will access your playlists and retrieve song metadata from Spotify, but without a server component, the application cannot, and will not, collect your Spotify preferences, settings or playlists.  This integration is just there for your convenience in building a local setlist.

## Contact Us

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update or change this Privacy Policy as necessary. Any updates will be posted on this page with the "Last Updated" date.

Thank you for using In the Pocket. I am committed to your privacy and appreciate your trust.
